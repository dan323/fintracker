# My Agent

I want this agent to review the Pull Requests. I want it to comment in them with suggestions for improvements, fixing bugs, make code clearer and list vulnerabilities. This application has a README.md and a WIP.md file that the agent should read to follow how the application is expected to work and what features it is expected to have.
